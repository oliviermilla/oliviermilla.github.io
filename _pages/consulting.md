With 10+ years of experience in building technology products and organizations, I partner with early to scaled-up teams who seek clarity and efficiency in their product strategy & execution.
Engagements typically fall into one of these categories:

## Organization Scaling
Everything starts and ends with people.
__“You crazy! I’m on a budget. I’m paying no consultant, got no money for that.”__
I hear you. Hear me out.
If I were to sell a pill that would upgrade your company one year forward, for the price of far less than a single month of expenses, would you take it?
__“Hmm. How are you planning on doing that?”__
With you. I’ll temporarily embed within your organization to ramp up execution from COMEX to intern. I’ll take ownership with your team so you keep building, get the results you want, and will know how to reproduce it when I leave. You will pay me when we hit KPI and not before.
__“Ok, but how do I know since I don’t know what I should know.”__
Well, chances are that if you are asking yourself one of the following questions, we should have a chat:

## Business Strategy

## Product Management

Product Management is about clarity, expectation, and risk management.
There is nothing more P&L impacting than drilling down the real reason users will love your product.
Product Management is regularly felt by businesspeople as defining the "how-to" to build the product. In reality, it is figuring out where to place the focus to deliver value.
If you need extra hands-on your product leadership or plain execution, I can help.

## HR Assessment
If you need a third eye to look at your team from an HR/skills point of view. I'm also partering with Avizio.

## Audit
You are probably a VC wondering what's inside the box.
